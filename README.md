# Holy-Halos
There might be many temples but at the same time there are few such temples that their grace is known to be much than the other, so few people exist there in large numbers. It is believed that having darshans of godâ€™s image one takes the energy that is offered by deity and receives blessing. Along with that there are endless ways through which people offer their sevas to god. But in few big temples where people exist in large numbers it is difficult to do all these on spot. They must have some prior idea or information about the services that they can offer. So in order to tackle this problem we propose a mini project Holy Halos which provides user friendly interface to let know the devotees that a particular temple offer different kind of sevas and poojas.
